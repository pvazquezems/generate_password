here i have created a password generator that spits out a random password based off the criteria that you'd like.
you can choose said criteria via a checkbox.
I made a mistake in altering my password generator to be more efficient (in my opinion) and taking what the instructor said "no one uses promts in real life" so thats why i switched to the boxes instead of the prompts.  later a fellow classmate informed me that 
it was actually not supposed to be altered, just make it work.  by that time it was impossible for me to finish it 
the way that it was wanted.  
my resources include w3school, codecademy, the book "Web Design with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery Set 1st Edition" and tutorials. 

i didnt erase any of the css that was given to us, but i added my own for my containers and results.  since i used
bootstrap i know i didnt need some of the media queries that were included in the css file. There are alo styling elements that are not in use becuase i switched them out for my own code, such as #password
anything to do with "before or after" etc. 

I altered the html to add my divs and thats about it. This thing was hard but knowledgeable.
